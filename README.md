# Duty bot
- when setting up the bot, don't forget to set env `TOKEN`:

      TOKEN="<YOUR BOT TOKEN>"

- after that, first go to `/settings` and enter ones which are true for you
- input your students with `/db`, groups with `/groups`, and group to do duty next with `/order <IDX of that group>`
- in your channel, post `/duty` to post the notification
- add channels and admins with `/add`
have fun!
